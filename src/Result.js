                    <br />Can I improve my intelligence? Scientific findings are
                    inconsistent regarding the potential of people to improve
                    their intelligence. Studies do show that functioning is more
                    optimal when people are more comfortable and enjoying what
                    they are doing, when people are interested in learning and
                    developing their abilities, and most interestingly â€“ when
                    people believe intelligence can be improved.<br /> Please
                    note that this test cannot serve as an official certificate
                    of your intelligence score.<br />
